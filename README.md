# Quantaive_Analysis_and_Projections
is a team project to demonstrate our collective ability to conduct financial analysis &amp; draw increasingly accurate predictions of major companies we deemed Heavy Hitters or simply Too Big To Fail within our economy and compare there metrics to the S&P 500 & one commodity being gas.

We selected 9 major companies:
APPL
MSFT
T
GOOG/GOOGL
AMZN
META
SPY
XOM

Once we determined their historical performance over the last 5 years, weâ€™ll set the weights and investment capital to project potential future  30 year returns using Monte Carlo simulations in hopes of finding some  insightful tips on how to adjust our strategy.

We followed the steps to execute our analysis and prediction simulation.

 #- Import Libraries needed and API from Alpaca 
```import os
import requests
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
from alpaca_trade_api.rest import REST, TimeFrame
import seaborn as sns
from MCForecastTools import MCSimulation
%matplotlib inline
```

#- Set Alpaca API key and secret
    Create the Alpaca API object
``` 
alpaca_api_key = os.getenv("ALPACA_API_KEY")
alpaca_secret_key = os.getenv("ALPACA_SECRET_KEY")
```

# Set start and end dates of five years back from today.
  Sample results may vary from the solution based on the time frame chosen
```
start_date = pd.Timestamp('2017-10-31', tz='America/New_York').isoformat()
end_date = pd.Timestamp('2022-10-31', tz='America/New_York').isoformat()
```
# Set the ticker information
```tickers = ["AAPL","MSFT","GOOG","GOOGL","AMZN","META","SPY"]```

# Reorganize the DataFrame
  Separate ticker data
```
AAPL=hh_5_year[hh_5_year['symbol']=='AAPL'].drop('symbol',axis=1)  # this is done for each individual ticker/stock
```
# Concatenate the ticker DataFrames
```
hh_5_year = pd.concat([AAPL, MSFT,T,GOOG,GOOGL,AMZN,META,SPY,XOM],axis=1, keys=['AAPL','MSFT','T','GOOG','GOOGL','AMZN','META','SPY','XOM'])
```
